=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module attempts to hijack L<Class::Accessor::Fast> in %INC and replace it
with L<MooX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast>. Make sure it is loaded before the
classes you have that use <Class::Accessor::Fast>. It is meant as a tool to help
you migrate your project from L<Class::Accessor::Fast>, to
L<MooX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast> and ultimately, to L<Moo>.
